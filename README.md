# water-quality-prediction
Overview
This project predicts whether a sample of water is safe for drinking (potable) using machine learning techniques. It is developed as part of the Edunet-AICTE Internship Program.

We apply data cleaning, preprocessing, and classification techniques to build an accurate model that can classify water quality based on various chemical and physical properties.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
The dataset contains features such as:

Feature	Description
pH	Acidity/alkalinity of water
Hardness	Concentration of calcium and magnesium
Solids	Total dissolved solids in ppm
Chloramines	Disinfectant level
Sulfate	Sulfate concentration
Conductivity	Electrical conductivity of water
Organic_carbon	Organic content
Trihalomethanes	Toxic compounds formed during chlorination
Turbidity	Clarity of water
Potability	Target (1 = drinkable, 0 = not drinkable)

ML Pipeline
1. Load and Inspect Dataset
2. Handle Missing Values (Imputation)
3. Remove Duplicates
4.Feature Scaling (Standardization)
5. Train-Test Split
6.Train Random Forest Classifier
